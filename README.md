# Image Hunt

**Image Hunt** is a fun and interactive Android game built using Jetpack Compose. The game challenges players to test their memory by identifying the correct animal images after they've been flipped over. With increasing difficulty across three game modes, it’s an engaging way to sharpen your observation and decision-making skills.
